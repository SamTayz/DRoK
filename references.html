        <h2>Macbeth</h2>
        <p>In Macbeth, Shakespeare really leans into the Divine Right of Kings. When Macbeth kills King Duncan, the world basically falls apart. The sun doesn’t rise, animals act strange, and everyone feels unsettled. It’s like nature itself is saying, “This wasn’t meant to happen.” The message is clear: killing a king chosen by God isn’t just wrong—it’s dangerous on every level.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>King James I</h2>
        <p>King James I didn’t just believe in the Divine Right—he said it out loud, a lot. In his speech to Parliament in 1609, he compared kings to gods on Earth. He said that just like God can judge us, only God can judge a king. It’s kind of wild to read now, but back then it was his way of telling Parliament to back off.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>Charles I</h2>
        <p>When Charles I was executed in 1649, it was a massive moment. People had always believed that kings were untouchable—chosen by God, above the law. But suddenly, here was a king being put on trial and killed by his own people. It was proof that not everyone still accepted the Divine Right, and it totally changed the way people saw royal power.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>The coronation oath</h2>
        <p>At British coronations, monarchs take an oath to serve the people—but in the past, they also swore to rule with God’s blessing. This tradition shows how deeply the Divine Right idea was tied into royal rituals. It’s toned down now, but you can still see traces of it in the way royal power is talked about as “sacred” or “anointed.”</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>Louis XIV</h2>
        <p>Over in France, King Louis XIV was another strong believer in the Divine Right. He called himself the "Sun King" and said, “I am the state.” He genuinely believed God had placed him on Earth to rule absolutely. His palace at Versailles is basically a monument to that belief—huge, golden, and designed to remind everyone of his power.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>English Bill of Rights</h2>
        <p>After years of conflict, Parliament finally pushed back hard. The English Bill of Rights basically said, “Okay, no more of that Divine Right stuff.” It limited royal power and made it clear that the king or queen had to work with Parliament. It didn’t fully get rid of the monarchy—but it ended the idea that they ruled because God said so.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>American Revolution</h2>
        <p>Even across the Atlantic, the Divine Right of Kings came up during the American Revolution. A lot of early Americans rejected the idea that someone should rule just because of their bloodline. They saw King George III as a tyrant, not a chosen one, and wanted leaders who were elected—not born into power.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>Monarchy Traditions</h2>
        <p>Even today, some royal traditions still quietly nod to the old idea of Divine Right. For example, during Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, she was anointed with holy oil in a secret moment under a canopy. It was meant to symbolise that her power came from God—not just from politics. The idea isn’t taken literally anymore, but that symbolism still lingers.</p>
