            <h1>Divine Right of Kings</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="subheadingflex">
            <p>The Divine Right of Kings was the idea that monarchs were chosen by God and given the authority to rule. This meant a king wasn’t just a political leader—he was seen as God’s representative on Earth. Because of that, disobeying the king wasn’t just breaking the law; it was going against the will of God. The belief gave kings enormous power and placed them above ordinary people, the Church, and even the law.</p>
            <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>The idea became especially powerful during the 16th and 17th centuries, when rulers across Europe were trying to keep control in times of conflict and change. By claiming that their authority came from God, kings could silence anyone who challenged them. It was a clever (and dangerous) way to protect their power, because it blurred the line between politics and religion. If you spoke out against the king, you weren’t just a rebel—you were a sinner.</p>
            <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>In England, this belief didn’t just shape royal attitudes—it helped shape the course of history. Henry VIII used religious authority to take control of the Church. James I openly defended Divine Right and clashed with Parliament over it. And Charles I took it so far that it helped spark a civil war and ultimately cost him his life. Over time, people began to question the idea that any ruler should have that much unchecked power—and the Divine Right of Kings started to fade.</p>
