        <p>The Divine Right of Kings had a huge impact on how people thought about power and who should have it. If a king believed he was chosen by God, he didn’t feel the need to explain himself or listen to anyone else—not even Parliament. That kind of thinking gave monarchs total control over their countries. They could make decisions, start wars, raise taxes, and silence anyone who disagreed with them. For a while, people accepted it. But as time went on, more and more started to question whether one person should really have that much power just because of their birth.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>In England, this belief caused serious problems. Kings like James I and Charles I refused to compromise, because they genuinely believed they were above everyone else. That mindset led to constant arguments with Parliament and, eventually, a full-on civil war. When Charles I was put on trial and executed in 1649, it shocked people. It wasn’t just the death of a king—it was a rejection of the whole idea that monarchs were untouchable and chosen by God. It showed that power could be challenged, even when it had always been seen as sacred.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>Even when the monarchy came back with Charles II, things had changed. The Divine Right of Kings never really recovered. People had seen what could happen when kings abused their power, and they didn’t want to go back to that. Over time, the focus shifted toward rulers being accountable and chosen by the people. The Divine Right had once given kings control over everything—but in the end, it helped spark the exact kind of resistance that led to fairer, more balanced governments.</p>
