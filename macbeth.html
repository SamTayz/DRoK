        <p>Shakespeare’s Macbeth powerfully supports the idea of the Divine Right of Kings by showing how dangerous it is when that order is broken. When Macbeth kills King Duncan, he’s not just committing murder—he’s interfering with something sacred. Duncan isn’t just a ruler; he’s chosen by God. Characters describe him in holy language, calling him “the Lord’s anointed” and comparing his murder to destroying a temple. Shakespeare makes it clear: killing a rightful king is a crime against both the state and God.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>After Duncan’s death, the world falls into chaos. The sky stays dark in the daytime, a falcon is killed by an owl, and Duncan’s horses turn wild and eat each other. These strange events aren’t just dramatic—they show that nature itself is reacting to the unnatural act of regicide. Shakespeare uses this imagery to show that when a king chosen by God is overthrown, the natural and moral order of the world collapses.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>Even once Macbeth becomes king, things don’t settle. His reign is filled with fear, paranoia, and violence. Because he wasn’t chosen by God and took the throne through murder, he can never truly rule with peace or legitimacy. He becomes obsessed with power, kills anyone he sees as a threat, and starts to lose his grip on reality. Shakespeare shows that power gained in the wrong way doesn’t last—and it destroys the person who takes it.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>Eventually, Malcolm—Duncan’s son and the rightful heir—returns to take back the throne. Unlike Macbeth, Malcolm doesn’t grab power through violence; instead, he is supported by others and seen as a symbol of hope and healing. He talks about ruling with “the grace of Grace,” showing that his authority is backed by God. When he takes the crown, order is restored, and the chaos Macbeth caused finally comes to an end.</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>At the time Macbeth was written, King James I was on the throne and strongly believed in the Divine Right of Kings. Shakespeare likely wrote the play to reflect and support James’s views. The message is clear: overthrowing a rightful king brings destruction, and only a God-chosen ruler can restore peace. In this way, Macbeth isn’t just a tragic story—it’s also a warning about the dangers of going against the divine order.</p>
